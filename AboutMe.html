            <h2>What I love</h2>
            <p>I love family, I'm cool with my friends and I don't hate people. I love Haitian cuisine but my favorite meal is Mac and Cheese which is American cuisine, I love pets (dogs, cats, hamsters, rabbits) anything else I consider a threat (snakes, spiders, alligators).
            I was raised in Christian church by default makes me  a Christian, but I am still figuring that part out, I don't really care about people's decisions as long as I am not affected by them. Last but not least Cars I love them, my favorite car is Honda Civic Type R.
